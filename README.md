# VirtualInteraction

- Currently, the script performs two tasks:
  - Holding only the middle and index finger up will allow interaction with the cursor.
  - Opening the thumb while keeping the middle and index finger up will act as a click button.

- Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Simply run the ``test.py`` script
